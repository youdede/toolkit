# Changelog

All notable changes are recorded here. Versions follow Semantic Versioning; release entries are derived from reviewed pull requests and verified against the corresponding Git tag.

## Unreleased

### Added

- `npm run check:changelog` refuses a build whose `package.json` version has no populated section in this file, and the release workflow refuses a tag that is not documented here. Together with the existing tag-to-version check, a release cannot ship describing itself as unreleased.

## 0.1.0 — 2026-08-25

### Added

- Repository governance, deterministic commit and branch policy, versioned Git hooks, pinned cross-platform CI, contribution templates, and reproducible protection settings.
- Public artifact-integrity attestations and semantic release-readiness evidence controls for the planned `0.1.0` release.
- `npm run check:contracts` fails the build when a prompt payload's output contract disagrees with the payload's own text or with its behavioral cases, covering heading membership, ordering, unresolvable section references, and duplicates.
- `npm run benchmark:release:build -- --full` evaluates every candidate behavioral case instead of the stratified sample. The release gate rebuilds using the policy recorded in the benchmark and refuses a policy that would sample less than the release minimum.
- A release workflow that publishes from a protected environment using npm trusted publishing, after verifying a signed annotated tag, a matching package version, and both release gates.

### Changed

- Expanded the catalog to 264 artifacts and seven outcome packs across six coding-agent runtimes.
- Every prompt-bearing artifact now states one unconditional output contract: the headings to return on every path, including when it declines or lacks inputs.
- Behavioral response checking no longer grades a self-reported disposition, and `requiredEvidence` phrases are reported as reviewer advice rather than enforced as literal substrings.
- Forbidden-phrase detection is scoped to the sentence rather than a fixed window, so a refusal or a report of what was requested no longer counts as an assertion. One guard governs every clearing rule: a first-person completed claim after a refusal is still a violation.

### Fixed

- Twelve guards and helper scripts passed their environment straight to `git`, so an inherited `GIT_DIR` made them inspect a repository other than the one they were pointed at, and report the result as if it came from the project in front of them. They now strip every `GIT_*` variable, matching the convention `protected-branch-guard` already used.
- `remove --force` resolved the hook marker from the entry being removed rather than from recorded state, so a forced removal could delete a marker it never installed.
- Concurrent installs shared no lock, and a refused install created a configuration root as a side effect.
- Subagent validation assumed a single target shape and rejected targets that identify an agent by filename.
- Unknown command-line flags were accepted silently.

### Removed

- Authoring research snapshots and origin-tracing records from the publishable repository surface.
